## How to interact on IRC

First off, for those of you who are asking what IRC is, go [get educated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). Though I'm sure that's only for the hot babes reading this (har har).

I've spent a good few years on IRC. From administering and maintaining channels, to noobing around in high-tech awesome sauce places that do nothing but confuse me. If you think making a scene for yourself when you're in an awkward or uncontrolled, inadequate situation would be fun, read on.

One thing I've noticed, especially from idling on somewhere like [freenode](http://freenode.org/), is that a lot of people are arrogant, obtuse, and are basically self certified prudent poop filled fuck muffins. If you'll excuse both the language and poor grammar.

I mean, when there's a serious conversation taking place, I totally agree that some etiquette should be upheld. But when did everything get so serious?

Here's your typical conversation on your typical freenode IRC channel:

{% highlight text %}
phil> Hello guys. How are your afternoons going? It's mighty sunny outside.
bernard> Why you're right, Phil. I have just pulled back my curtains to reveal the
		most immense of sun rays. It almost hurt my oculus.
sebastian> My gosh Phil, you guys are having tremendous weather there it seems. Ours
		it not so good. It seems there is a hint of perspiration in the air.
phil> Uh oh, that's not good. Get ready to pull out the good 'ol umbrella! hehe.
{% endhighlight %}

Ok so I exaggerate, but c'mon, this is the direction this blog post was always going to head.

Here's how people **should** interact:

phil> Yo what up guys, DANG ITS SO HOOOTTTTTTT outside
berny> true true, i've just got my ass outta bed, that shit is melting my eye balls :( :( :(
sebastian> well screw you both, it's fucking raining here!?!?!?! :@ Ang3r!!!1!!1!three"1!
phil> hahahaha pwned
berny> LOL DONGS

So only now you realize I'm just blog trolling. But seriously.....
