## I'll lay you on a bed of roses, Google

I've had the pleasure of having to implement a lot of Google services for organizational and business use over the last couple of days. After being put off of many Google products since Buzz, I decided to give them another go. This includes configuring a Google apps account with support for mail, and collaborative work on documents.

I challenged Google, and Google has responded with majestic awesomeness. Not that Google cares, but it's certainly earned infinity kudos from me. Even if YouTube is filled with lulz. So yes, I'm celebrating because it's made my life about 138 times easier this week.

I last used Google docs a couple of years ago. It's was.. mediocre. I think the idea is awesome, but it was filled with bugs and just sprouted immense deficiency.

But hay, how it's hella awesome.

I'm even thinking about using docs for my invoice work, too. Business collaboration is easy and a cinch to configure. Mail is as you'd expect, sweet.

Now I've completed tasks about 4 hours earlier than expected.. This means I have time to party. AND WHAT DO WE BRING TO PARTIES LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?!

Yes sir.

PS: Uh oh Google
