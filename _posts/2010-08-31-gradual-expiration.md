## Gradual expiration

So this past week has been more than tough. I've lost internet, I've lost some living arrangements, and I've lost a little bit of my mind. Although the latter is a naturally re-occurring event. Thanks to lianj the server is still alive, without his donation this week I'm not sure it would have been around much longer, every little helps a lot! Also, a massive thanks to Kyle who's helping me with some ISP bills. You tha bomb!

So apart from my enthralling decline this week, what else have I been up to? Well, as we all know, [Rails 3 was released](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/8/29/rails-3-0-it-s-done). Which I hate to say, but... it fixes at least 60% of what I hated about Rails. Which is a pretty damn large percentage. I'm even thinking about throwing up some apps for a couple of clients of mine, **shock**!

There's one thing bugging me though, [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/). I just.. don't get it. What's the raving all about? I don't see why it's such a great tool. I'm not saying it's bad, but any clarification or examples might help me figure this one out.

Some cool things to note this week:

1.  [home_run](http://github.com/jeremyevans/home_run) - Super fast DateTime classes for Ruby. An awesome library from Jeremy Evans, the author of the second to none ORM [Sequel](http://sequel.rubyforge.org/)!

2. [GitHub Pull Requests 2.0](http://github.com/blog/712-pull-requests-2-0) - GitHub has added extra pull request functionality. I gotta say, this is awesome. The interface is really really nice, too. Just go read the post.

3. [CSS3 Playground](http://css3.mikeplate.com/) - A pretty damn epic CSS3 toolbox, test CSS3 code directly in your browser.

4. [Ruby 1.9.2](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2010/08/18/ruby-1-9-2-is-released/) - That's right, 1.9.2 has been released. I'm using it now and although there aren't any major changes other than the current working directory `.` being removed from the `$LOAD_PATH` it's still pretty neat. If you're using RVM it's as simple as `rvm update --head && rvm install 1.9.2 && rvm reload`. Simple.

5. [Rubydoc](http://rubydoc.info/) - Just look. Seriously.

Unfortunately due to the lack of internet and lack of life the last week, I haven't been able to fix some issues with Cinch, namely the lack of specifications. I know I know, I suck. It's on the TODO list though. Dominik has been ploughing away at issues and Cinch is started to get more and more interest both on the IRC channel and the GitHub watch list. Keep 'em coming!

After looking at some of the analytics of this blog, I'm extremely surprised how popular it seems to be, what with my dysfunctional writing style and abrasive lack of creativeness. I honestly do plan on writing something worth reading at some point, so don't lose hope on me too quickly!
