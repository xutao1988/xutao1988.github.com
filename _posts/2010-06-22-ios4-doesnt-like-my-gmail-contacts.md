## iOS4 doesn't like my Gmail contacts

Once upon a day there was a guy, a simple guy. A technology loving, athletic, admirable, majestic, smart guy. This guy owned an iPhone. Pretty, it was. Then [this](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/wwdc10/index.html) happened. Steve Jobs introduced the new features of the new highly anticipated iOS4, Apples new mobile operating system.

Of course, I was excited.. er, he was excited. If he was a puppy someone would have been cleaning the unfortunate secretion he would have created on the new lounge carpet. He felt like a kid with a new toy, or at least a release day for a new toy.

So then came along yesterday. The release of the new magical operating system which turns your iPhone into a multi-tasking sensation. If you were one of the sad sad people who were watching [this feed](http://www.google.com/search?q=%23ios4+site:twitter.com&source=lnms&tbs=mbl:1) I salute you for your patience, and smack you for your geeky sadness (You can smack me back, I did the same).

The new system works as expected. Though the are many people [reporting issues](http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/06/21/ios-4-smooth-as-sick-or-buggy-as-hell/), fortunately I've just had one.

**The worst most annoying one!**

I use the [Exchange syncing service](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740&topic=14252) with Google. Which worked flawlessly.

Until now.

I have this many contacts in my address book: 0

My calender has managed to Sync, yet my emails have not. I receive an error about connecting to the Google mail servers when I try to sync.

As I can see, the issue has been discussed [here](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=11718615&tstart=0), [here](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=0aea7857b25a174f&hl=en), oh and [here again](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google%20Mobile/thread?tid=3660e3e8f0d5154f&hl=en) which was linked back to [here](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Mobile/thread?tid=2aba4d3a3908b354&hl=en). So are there actually any solutions?

It's been over 24 hours now, I still have no contacts. I'm about to kill Google.

Any readers have the same issues, and any possible fixes? I don't want to result in having to use iTunes to sync my damn contacts.
