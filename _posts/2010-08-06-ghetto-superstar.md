## Ghetto Superstar

So I'm hoping by the time I complete this blog post, I'll be a year older than I was when I started it. Yes my birthday is in 30 minutes from now. But what happened.. I don't get excited like I did when I was 10. It sucks!

My girlfriend has dropped off my presents so whilst she's at work in the morning, I can spend a good hour indulging in my goods. I'm looking forward to it! There's been one thing bugging me though.. One of the presents is a strange triangular shape, quite large. Almost looks like it could be a guitar or something of that shape, but I know it's not that. If anyone can guess it before tomorrow evening, I'll send you some love!

I don't really have much time to write, so let me bullet point some stuff I have started doing and I'll hopefully follow these up with some blog posts soon.

1. Started using [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) - gone are the days of bash (And I'm so happy with it!)
2. Jailbroke my iPhone (yes I know everyone has) -- got some cool/interesting hacks to share
3. Wrote some (my first) [VIM](http://vim.org/) scripts. I love them
4. Wrote some Haskell code for a client -- Well worth knowing
5. Bitched about Perl 6 a little (bitched = cried in pain)
6. Laughed at Google wave being discontinued

Ok I really have to go. Happy Birthday to me! etc
