## Colossal Simplicity

I've just managed to get around to merging the `ramaze` branch of this [blog](http://github.com/injekt/blog) here which has added some aesthetic-al changes. Namely the red button style links at the bottom of the page, and the implementation of post tags. I figured I was actually doing fairly well with building up posts, so why not add a little simplicity in the form of tags. Now each post will contain a set of blue like tag buttons. Yay and such!

The administration area also has a re-vamp, which of course you can't enjoy, but I can! This does mean I have to wave goodbye to [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/), which is a shame because it's a great little framework. I did however want something a little larger as I started adding more functionality. Ramaze fits the mould pretty damn well as it usually does for me.

If anyone has any cross browser style issues or thinks I should add/remove something, please let me know. Any feedback is much appreciated. I'm now going to attempt to get some sleep, as I haven't done so in so many days. I'm starting to think I have insomnia, which unfortunately runs in my family. Dammit!
