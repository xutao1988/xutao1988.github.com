## Aviating porkers

Those of you who remember the absolutely awesome days of playing [Duke Nukem 3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D) and co on old ass Windows machines will know that two days ago, pigs flew.

That's right, the [3D Realms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Realms)  president George Broussard joked that the cigar smoking, babe hunting, beer drinking hit man would be back when pigs flew. Well, take a look at his [Twitter status](http://twitter.com/georgeb3dr/status/22750844938) from a couple of days ago.

Indeed, Duke is coming back to the arena. Back home to shrink and step on more aliens than ever before. [Gearbox](http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/) have taken on the ghastly high profile task of bring back this awesome FPS. Can they do it? We'll find out in 2011. It's going to be a massive project for them, and I'm really really hoping they pull it off. I'll certainly be waiting for my copy on the Xbox 360.
