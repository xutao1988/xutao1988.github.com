## Why I rarely use my Android device

As an owner of both an Android and iPhone handset, I get asked the same question a lot. Why do you **never** have your Android device with you? I'm a huge Android fan, so you'd think this question might be send me into a mind numbing state. Well, it's actually a very simple answer... Because I prefer using my iPhone. It's really THAT simple.

* Do I think my iPhone has more features than my Android device? No, I don't.
* Do I think my iPhone is nicer to use on a daily basis? Yes, I do.
* Do I prefer writing iOS applications over Android applications? No, I much prefer the latter.
* Am I an Apple fanboy? No, I'm a Linux fanboy and always have been.

People rarely notice the fact that Android devices have **many** more features than the more popular iPhone, so why are they so popular? And why am I choosing to use my iPhone over my Android phone?

Well.. it has nothing to do with features. It has nothing to do with how the device feels in the palm of my metacarpus. It has nothing to do with the camera, and it has nothing to do with applications (though the Apple app store **is** second to none). I use my iPhone over my Android phone for one reason, it's **fast and responsive**. Yep, that's it. There really isn't a better reason. I have played with many Android devices and **none** of them seem anywhere near as responsive as my iPhone.

Now, I'm not attempting to open a booming mooting match about this subject. Android isn't tailored for specific devices, it runs on a grandiose selection of gadgets, where Apples mobile operating system is tailored specifically for it's hardware, much like all Apple software. I get that, and I'm a true believer in that being the reason the iPhone, iPad, and iPod devices are so responsive. But until I pick up an Android device and it's as responsive as my iPhone is, I won't **ever** use one for anything more that development.

I'm tired of new Android devices being released and followed by articles containing the words *"It's a close contender to the iPhone"* or *"it's second only to the iPhone"*. I mean, really? Maybe I'm missing something here, but I truly believe the Android operating system is more **feature packed** than iOS, so lets build a device good enough to show it off, I know I'd make the leap if this were an option.
