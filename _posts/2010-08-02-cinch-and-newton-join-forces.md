## Cinch and Newton join forces!

That's right, [Cinch](http://doc.injekt.net/cinch) and Newton are indeed combining libraries and making sweet sweet IRC love. This does mean that we will be bringing some incompatible changes, but according to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), you can't bitch at me because Cinch is only at version 0.3! :-)

Luckily these changes are for the better! [Dominik Honnef](http://fork-bomb.org/) is the author of the Newton library and has put in a lot of work into Newton, and we plan on implementing some extremely awesome features! Including the ability to use named parameter support, which was a huge hit in the original version of Cinch.

The next couple of weeks is likely to be crucial in Cinch development. We plan on implementing a plugin system allowing users to create self contained plugins to be executed when a rule is matched. We also have a little sneaky surprise for users who're interested in creating and deploying plugins, but that's at a very early age right now.

Want to keep updated on changes? Check out the merge branch of Cinch over [here](http://github.com/injekt/cinch/tree/merge). I'll keep everyone updated on major feature changes. Also feel free to join #cinch on [irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org/cinch) to bitch at me about the incompatible changes and send praise for the better features which you'll soon have access to.
