## C++ A grandiose abomination

What? All the cool kids are saying it.

Yes this of course is the news that C++ totally wtfsucks. If you're a geek like me and hang around on places like /r/programming, or perhaps StubleUpon.. hell if you've lived under a rock for the last 2 weeks; I'm sure you would have seen numerous attacks against the free-form programming language, and of course those who oppose these nasty outbreaks and hit back with senseless hogwash in an attempt to nourish the thoughts of their chosen language. Ehm.

This all started when Mr. Zed Shaw wrote this post on a mailing list, archiving his thoughts on the language. For those of you who don't know Zed, he's known for his rants. Specifically one entitled Rails is a Ghetto, a rant I can honestly say I agree with to a large extent, but I'm digressing..

Is it just me or can anyone else see that his ranting comments aren't actually excruciatingly scandalous like everyone seems to be making out? I mean, he likes C and thinks it's much more suited to Mongrel2, the Bruce to the Thomas that was Mongrel. (If you don't understand that, go watch some movies). He could have been a lot worse. I know I would/could have been. Even Linus made Zeds comments look weak compared to his thoughts.

Well you know what happens when someone says something sucks, everyone comes out of their hiding places to start blogging and ranting, I MEAN COME ON GUYS STOP BLOGGING ABOUT THIS ALREADY. Yeah yeah, touche.

Oh look, another post popped up on r/programming entitled: In the heat of the moment, it's easy to lose sight of just how much of C++ is absolutely senseless wankery. But unfortunately the website was down.. how convenient.

Without causing a mass exodus or something, I'd like to know what you guys think of C++, just something small in the comments will do.
