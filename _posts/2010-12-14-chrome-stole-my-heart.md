## Chrome Stole my heart

Today marks a very important day in my internet browsing experience. I have made the push to start using the [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) web browser over its [Firefox](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/) counterpart. Why? Well, let me explain..

Firefox hasn't always been my favourite browser. The fact is, I never really **loved** any of them. There was always something that bothered me about one of them. Of course, being a web designer, I use all of them extremely often, unfortunately. I used [Opera](http://opera.com) for quite some time (3+ years), before getting fed up with the slow start times (though it did excel in page loading for a long long time).

I made the push to Chromium about the same time as the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) was released. Lots of great applications, extensions, and themes all in one place.

There was something else that bothered me with Chrome. It was the way [GitHub](http://github.com) styles their *code* font. It just looked extremely ugly in Chrome, though fine in Firefox or Opera. Luckily installing the [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) extension meant I could customize any webpage I wished, and stylebot saved my CSS for the next time I visited the page. Neat, right?

Once I used Stylebot to change the font to 
[Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera),
it looked much **much** nicer. It may be such a subtle difference to many people, but I spend a lot of time reading code on GitHub, and this really really frustrated me. It's nice to see how easy it can be customized.

I've taken some time to read over a few of the hot looking applications on the Chrome web store, and I think it's certainly something to keep an eye on in the future.
