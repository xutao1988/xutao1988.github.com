## Totally MIA

I know I know, it's been far too long since I last posted. This blog has come so close to joining the die hard has-beens in the heavily abundant grave yard I have unwillingly created and buried my existing attempts at blogging. So what have I been doing? Well..

1. [Halo: Reach](http://www.bungie.net/projects/reach/default.aspx) came out. So my time has been occupied taking down the covenant (getting my ass whoop'd) and building an awesome armory (slowly).
2. I've been messing around with the [Redcar Editor](http://redcareditor.com/), it's a very very awesome TextMate like programmers editor based on plug-ins. It's built entirely on jRuby meaning you can easily extend its plugin base with your own Ruby-esque additions. Some may even say it's the free multi platform equivalent of TextMate.
3. Being broke. That's right, penny-less! Work **should** be kicking up a little more this month, though. I've got some new material to sink my teeth into and I'm excited at the prospects.
4. Doing **more** Rails 3 stuff. Yes I am indeed starting to like it, even if pre 3 sucked balls.

I do intend to continue blogging at an increased rate (a post per week, at the very least) so anyone who's actually interested in reading any of the absolute twaddle I write about, feel free to give me a sweet kick up the ass from time to time. I know I need it.
