## Where for art thou RVM?

So after my spending a couple of days recompiling both of my laptops (yes, **both**) because they just happened to give up on life and wanted the pleasure of hearing me scream like a [howler monkey](http://www.google.com/images?q=howler+monkey), I've soon come to the realization that installing Ruby is one of the easiest, and most beautiful experiences I've had the pleasure of taking part in.

No, I'm serious.

I spend a lot of time reconfiguring my systems (both desktop and server environments) from easy Ubuntu to the usual excitingly sticky Gentoo (ftw). Whilst moaning about my constant issues with running multiple versions of Ruby across multiple platforms, the same thing kept popping up over the IRC channels; rvm.

"What's that?" I said
"Ruby Version Manager" they said
"Pfft, no thanks" I responded

Well, I have retreated with my tail between my legs, the egg is indeed smeared across my face. [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) is one of the best surprises of the last couple of months for me. [Wayne E. Seguin](http://beginrescueend.com/) has done a simply amazing job with the Ruby Version Manager. I've spent time disregarding its beauty, time I cannot replace. Judging by the way RVM has treated me though, it's certainly forgiven me for my sins.

RVM isn't just for the people who are looking for multiple versions of Ruby on the same system. RVM is all you need. Gone are the days of using package managers to install old versions of Ruby, or grabbing the source yourself and compiling. Lay back, let RVM do all that stuff for you, whilst managing the many versions it supports.

Check out [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com), I promise you it's the best move you've made since clicking the link to this entry.

Oh and just to finish it off, aside from being an awesome product; RVM has an unforgettable website banner.
