## Soapy and sterilized

I've decided to hit [injekt.net](http://injekt.net) with a fresh design and a complete new backend. This was something I could work on whilst I was migrating my [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=503054a6eaf39a4dbe1bdec90eba2f3c1cf2bb21) VPS. Now I have reinstalled [Gentoo](http://gentoo.org) everything is running pretty darn smooth, for now at least.

I have also opted to remove the comment threads. Mainly as they weren't being used but also because I'd like anyone who may have a comment or any feedback to send it to me personally whether it's via email or Twitter. This method seems to work well for others, and saves me maintaining a comment thread (albeit an empty one) and any public shenanigans which may occur.

The new blogging interface is designed for simplicity and is aimed to be more of a miniblog than a journal. I realize I'm not one of these people who can maintain a weekly blog, so I'll spend time creating short, simple, concise posts when and as I please. So no pressure!
